### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
[Who am I?]
I am a programmer now who aspires to become a solo indie game developer. Recently, I aim to gamify various ideas.

I majored in a master's degree in mechanical engineering and worked for 6 months at an IT AI startup.

Currently, I am studying game development and game artificial intelligence in my spare time while majoring in computer vision and reinforcement learning artificial intelligence in graduate school.

[~2022]
During this period, this page contains my code-work history, and also my interests and ideas for AI research.
I mainly used OpenCV Python and Javascript.
Others were Java, C, Matlab...etc.

[2023~] :) 
From this year, I am studing C#, and Unity for game development.
I am interested in Mobile Casual game, and VR&AR game.
