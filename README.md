### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
[Who am I?]
I am a programmer and engineer.

Currently, I am studying game development and game artificial intelligence in my spare time while majoring in computer vision and reinforcement learning artificial intelligence in graduate school.

[~2022]
During this period, this page contains my code-work history, and also my interests and ideas for AI research.
I mainly used OpenCV Python.

[2023~] :) 
From this year, I am studing C#, and Unity for machine learning with game or apps.
I am interested in any valuable service developments.
